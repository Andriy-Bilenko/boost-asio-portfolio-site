# boost-asio-portfolio-site (https://bilenko.sytes.net)
## About the program
Of course there are a lot of already established server programs, but for the sake of learning Boost ASIO and trying out network programming, these small HTTP and HTTPS servers were created.
I was curious how do some people host websites accessible through tor network, so I hosted one (http://defaultuzrc5mqrl2r73673vwgvpzscoubjb7n23wezmyq4ffoyjeiyd.onion), and told how to do that below.
Also I was surprized when I noticed some IP's that are not mine or my friends' visiting my site, and there were a lot of them, so I composed a python IP lookup script that traverses the list of IPs using freely accessible webservice through "torred" firefox browser and outputs the geolocation and the organisation visiting.

## Server setup
**Ubuntu:**
`sudo apt update`
`sudo apt install g++ make`
`sudo apt install libboost-all-dev`
`sudo apt-get install libssl-dev`
`dpkg -s libboost-all-dev | grep Version`
**Arch linux (might not be the full list):**
`sudo pacman -Syu`
`sudo pacman -S base-devel`
`sudo pacman -S boost boost-libs openssl boost-asio`
**to run the server:**
`cd http` or `cd https`
`sudo make run`

to test it out visit https://localhost or http://localhost respectively
## Onion website
#### Setup
On arch linux `sudo pacman -S tor`
On ubuntu `sudo apt install tor`
On both `sudo service tor start`

after that add lines
```
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/your_hidden_service_name/
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:80
```
somewhere to `/etc/tor/torrc`
then restart tor service:
`sudo systemctl restart tor`

-  make sure your HTTP server is up and running
-  allow connections from outside on port 80 (and to be doubly sure on port 9050)
-  install [tor browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/)
-  and visit your website on link in the file `/var/lib/tor/your_hidden_service_name/hostname`.

Note #3: If changes are made to the torrc you'd normally need to refresh the tor service.

#### Extra: customizing v3 .onion link
you can use [eschalot tool](https://github.com/ReclaimYourPrivacy/eschalot) , `./eschalot -ct5 -p {name}` and get yourself the .onion hostname starting with {name}. Put files `hostname`, `hs_ed25519_public_key` and `hs_ed25519_secret_key` in place of the same files in `/var/lib/tor/your_hidden_service_name/` and restart tor service. Clear cache and restart tor browser if you want to see changes made.

## Lookup script
**On arch:**
`sudo pacman -S python`
`sudo pacman -S python-virtualenv`
**On ubuntu**
`sudo apt install python3`
`sudo apt install python3-venv`
**to run it:**
make sure to have sessions.log in the same directory as the script and tor service installed
`python3 -m venv venv`
`source venv/bin/activate`
`python ip_lookup.py`
(upon errors install needed python modules using pip)
